PROBLEM STATEMENT

In today’s digital world, privacy in online communication is a major concern. Traditional chat applications are vulnerable to hacking, making confidential conversations susceptible to eavesdropping. This project aims to develop a secure chat system that ensures end-to-end encryption using AES-256 encryption, making intercepted messages unreadable to attackers.




TECHNOLOGY USED

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

socket – For client-server communication

cryptography (PyCryptodome) – For AES-256 encryption and decryption

tkinter – For the GUI-based chat interface


Platforms:

Windows/Linux/Mac






WOW FACTORS

End-to-End Encryption: Messages are encrypted before transmission and decrypted only by the intended recipient.

No Data Storage: Messages are not stored on a server, ensuring privacy.

Lightweight & Fast: Minimal resource usage while providing high security.

Custom Encryption Key: Users can set their own encryption keys for added security.





END USERS

Professionals communicating sensitive information

Students and researchers requiring private discussions

Companies ensuring secure internal communication

Individuals concerned about online privacy





RESULTS



1. Encrypted message transmission between clients.


2. AES key generation and secure message decryption.


3. Graphical user interface (GUI) for an easy-to-use chat experience.






CONCLUSION

This project successfully implements a secure chat application using AES encryption, addressing the issue of insecure communication. It ensures confidentiality, prevents unauthorized access, and provides an easy-to-use interface for secure messaging.




FUTURE SCOPE

Implementing RSA encryption for key exchange.

Adding support for voice and video encryption.

Integrating with mobile platforms (Android & iOS).

PROBLEM STATEMENT

With increasing digital threats, securely hiding confidential data in images is crucial.
This project implements steganography to conceal text within images, ensuring data security.


---

TECHNOLOGY USED

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

OpenCV (Image processing)

NumPy (Matrix operations)

Cryptography (AES encryption for added security)


Platforms: Windows/Linux/Mac



---

WOW FACTORS

Hidden Message: Text is securely embedded within image pixels.

Strong Encryption: Uses AES encryption before embedding data.

Image Integrity: Hidden data does not alter visible image quality.

Secure Retrieval: Only authorized users can extract and decrypt the hidden text.



---

END USERS

Government agencies for secure communication.

Journalists and activists needing covert information storage.

Organizations securing confidential records.

Individuals concerned about private data protection.



---

RESULTS

1. Original Image – Before hiding the message.


2. Encrypted Image – Image containing the secret text.


3. Extracted & Decrypted Message – Retrieved from the image successfully.




---

CONCLUSION

This project successfully hides sensitive data within images using steganography.
It enhances security, ensuring unauthorized users cannot detect or extract hidden messages.


---



FUTURE SCOPE

Implementing video steganography.

Enhancing encryption with RSA-AES hybrid encryption.

Integrating AI-based detection resistance mechanisms.
